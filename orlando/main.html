                <p><b>The Wildest Ride in the Wilderness</b></p>
                <p>Legend has it that soon after gold was first discovered here in the 1850s, eerie things began to

                    and board your train. As you enter the cursed cavern, the engine speeds up along the rickety track.

                    through the mysterious ghost town of Tumbleweed.</p>

                    moved to Disneyland Park and was renamed “The Carousel of Progress.”</p>
                <p>In 1975, the attraction moved to Magic Kingdom park where it was rewritten and restaged with a new
                    theme song, “The Best Time of Your Life.”</p>

                    with Popeye's best gal, Olive Oyl, and the only way to save her involves an 18-foot octopus and
                    a lot of water. Hold on tight as you brave your way through raging rapids. You'll laugh. You'll
                    scream. You'll be really wet and squooshy.</p>

                    twist on the classic carnival ride. If you look up high, you'll see Horton the Elephant

                    As you make your way, Hagrid gives instructions on the proper way to approach a Hippogriff, a
                    magical creature that's part eagle, part horse. This family-friendly roller coaster spirals and
                    dives around the pumpkin patch before swooping past Hagrid's hut.</p>

                <p>Summary: Climb inside your very own Dr. Seuss flying fish. It's equipped with easy-to-use
                    controls that let you maneuver up, up, up and down, down, down as you gently glide around an
                    array of fountains that squirt water in time to a musical rhyme. Make sure you pay attention to
                    the words and do what they say or you just might get wet.</p>

                    fate of the planet is literally in your hands.</p>
