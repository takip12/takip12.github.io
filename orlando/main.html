                <p><b>The Wildest Ride in the Wilderness</b></p>
                <p>Legend has it that soon after gold was first discovered here in the 1850s, eerie things began to

                    and board your train. As you enter the cursed cavern, the engine speeds up along the rickety track.

                    through the mysterious ghost town of Tumbleweed.</p>

                <p>In 1975, the attraction moved to Magic Kingdom park where it was rewritten and restaged with a new
                    theme song, “The Best Time of Your Life.”</p>
